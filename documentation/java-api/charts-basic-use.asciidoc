[[charts.basic-use]]
= Basic Use

The [classname]#Chart# is a regular Vaadin component, which you can add to a
layout. You can give the chart type in the constructor or set it later in the
chart model.

[source, java]
----
Chart chart = new Chart(ChartType.COLUMN);

//or

Chart chart = new Chart();
chart.getConfiguration().getChart().setType(ChartType.COLUMN);
...
layout.addComponent(chart);
----

The chart types are described in
<<dummy/../../../charts/java-api/charts-charttypes#charts.charttypes,"Chart Types">>. The
main parts of a chart are illustrated in <<figure.charts.overview.elements>>.

[[figure.charts.overview.elements]]
.Chart Elements
image::img/charts-elements-lo.png[]

To actually display something in a chart, you typically need to configure the
following aspects:

* Basic chart configuration
* Configure __plot options__ for the chart type
* Configure one or more __data series__ to display
* Configure __axes__

The plot options can be configured for each data series individually, or for
different chart types in mixed-type charts.

[[charts.basic-use.configuration]]
== Basic Chart Configuration

After creating a chart, you need to configure it further. At the least, you need
to specify the data series to be displayed in the configuration.

Most methods available in the [classname]#Chart# object handle its basic Vaadin
component properties. All the chart-specific properties are in a separate
[classname]#Configuration# object, which you can access with the
[methodname]#getConfiguration()# method.

[source, java]
----
Configuration conf = chart.getConfiguration();
conf.setTitle("Reindeer Kills by Predators");
conf.setSubTitle("Kills Grouped by Counties");
----

The configuration properties are described in more detail in
<<dummy/../../../charts/java-api/charts-configuration#charts.configuration,"Chart
Configuration">>.


[[charts.basic-use.plotoptions]]
== Plot Options

Many chart settings can be configured in the __plot options__ of the chart or
data series. Some of the options are chart type specific, as described later for
each chart type, while many are shared.

For example, for line charts, you could disable the point markers as follows:

[source, java]
----
// Disable markers from lines
PlotOptionsLine plotOptions = new PlotOptionsLine();
plotOptions.setMarker(new Marker(false));
conf.setPlotOptions(plotOptions);
----

You can set the plot options for the entire chart or for each data series
separately, allowing also mixed-type charts, as described in
<<charts.basic-use.mixed>>.

The shared plot options are described in
<<dummy/../../../charts/java-api/charts-configuration#charts.configuration.plotoptions,"Plot
Options">>.


[[charts.basic-use.data]]
== Chart Data Series

The data displayed in a chart is stored in the chart configuration as a list of
[classname]#Series# objects. A new data series is added in a chart with the
[methodname]#addSeries()# method.

[source, java]
----
ListSeries series = new ListSeries("Diameter");
series.setData(4900,  12100,  12800,
               6800,  143000, 125000,
               51100, 49500);
conf.addSeries(series);
----

The data can be specified with a number of different series types
[classname]#DataSeries#, [classname]#ListSeries#, [classname]#HeatSeries#
and [classname]#TreeSeries#.

Data point features, such as name and data labels, can be defined in the versatile
[classname]#DataSeries#, which contains [classname]#DataSeriesItem# items.
Special chart types, such as box plots and 3D scatter charts require using their
own special data point type.

The data series configuration is described in more detail in
<<dummy/../../../charts/java-api/charts-data#charts.data,"Chart Data">>.


[[charts.basic-use.axis]]
== Axis Configuration

One of the most common tasks for charts is customizing its axes. At the least,
you usually want to set the axis titles. Usually you also want to specify labels
for data values in the axes.

When an axis is categorical rather than numeric, you can define category labels
for the items. They must be in the same order and the same number as you have
values in your data series.

[source, java]
----
XAxis xaxis = new XAxis();
xaxis.setCategories("Mercury", "Venus",   "Earth",
                    "Mars",    "Jupiter", "Saturn",
                    "Uranus",  "Neptune");
xaxis.setTitle("Planet");
conf.addxAxis(xaxis);
----

Formatting of numeric labels can be done with JavaScript expressions, for
example as follows:

[source, java]
----
// Set the Y axis title
YAxis yaxis = new YAxis();
yaxis.setTitle("Diameter");
yaxis.getLabels().setFormatter(
  "function() {return Math.floor(this.value/1000) + \'Mm\';}");
yaxis.getLabels().setStep(2);
conf.addyAxis(yaxis);
----


[[charts.basic-use.two-dimensional]]
== Displaying Multiple Series

The simplest data, which we saw in the examples earlier in this chapter, is
one-dimensional and can be represented with a single data series. Most chart
types support multiple data series, which are used for representing
two-dimensional data. For example, in line charts, you can have multiple lines
and in column charts the columns for different series are grouped by category.
Different chart types can offer alternative display modes, such as stacked
columns. The legend displays the symbols for each series.

[source, java]
----
// The data
// Source: V. Maijala, H. Norberg, J. Kumpula, M. Nieminen
// Calf production and mortality in the Finnish
// reindeer herding area. 2002.
String predators[] = {"Bear", "Wolf", "Wolverine", "Lynx"};
int kills[][] = {        // Location:
        {8,   0,  7, 0}, // Muddusjarvi
        {30,  1, 30, 2}, // Ivalo
        {37,  0, 22, 2}, // Oraniemi
        {13, 23,  4, 1}, // Salla
        {3,  10,  9, 0}, // Alakitka
};

// Create a data series for each numeric column in the table
for (int predator = 0; predator < 4; predator++) {
    ListSeries series = new ListSeries();
    series.setName(predators[predator]);

    // The rows of the table
    for (int location = 0; location < kills.length; location++)
        series.addData(kills[location][predator]);
    conf.addSeries(series);
}
----

The result for both regular and stacked column chart is shown in
<<figure.charts.basic-use.two-dimensional>>. Stacking is enabled with
[methodname]#setStacking()# in [classname]#PlotOptionsColumn#.

[[figure.charts.basic-use.two-dimensional]]
.Multiple Series in a Chart
image::img/charts-twodimensional.png[]


[[charts.basic-use.mixed]]
== Mixed Type Charts

You can enable mixed charts by setting the chart type in the
[classname]#PlotOptions# object for a data series, which overrides the default
chart type set in the [classname]#Chart# object. You can also control the animation and
other settings for the series in the plot options.

For example, to get a line chart, you need to use [classname]#PlotOptionsLine#.

[source, java]
----
// A data series as column graph
DataSeries series1 = new DataSeries();
PlotOptionsColumn options1 = new PlotOptionsColumn();
series1.setPlotOptions(options1);
series1.setData(4900,  12100,  12800,
    6800,  143000, 125000, 51100, 49500);
conf.addSeries(series1);

// A data series as line graph
ListSeries series2 = new ListSeries("Diameter");
PlotOptionsLine options2 = new PlotOptionsLine();
series2.setPlotOptions(options2);
series2.setData(4900,  12100,  12800,
    6800,  143000, 125000, 51100, 49500);
conf.addSeries(series2);
----

In the above case, where we set the chart type for each series, the overall
chart type is irrelevant.


[[charts.basic-use.3d]]
== 3D Charts

Most chart types can be made 3-dimensional by adding 3D options to the chart.
You can rotate the charts, set up the view distance, and define the thickness of
the chart features, among other things. You can also set up a 3D axis frame
around a chart.

[[figure.charts.basic-use.3d.pie]]
.3D Charts
image::img/charts-3d-pie.png[]

[[charts.basic-use.3d.options]]
=== 3D Options

3D view has to be enabled in the [classname]#Options3d# configuration, along
with other parameters. Minimally, to have some 3D effect, you need to rotate the
chart according to the __alpha__ and __beta__ parameters.

Let us consider a basic scatter chart for an example. The basic configuration
for scatter charts is described elsewhere, but let us look how to make it 3D.

[source, java]
----
Chart chart = new Chart(ChartType.SCATTER);
Configuration conf = chart.getConfiguration();
... other chart configuration ...

// In 3D!
Options3d options3d = new Options3d();
options3d.setEnabled(true);
options3d.setAlpha(10);
options3d.setBeta(30);
options3d.setDepth(135); // Default is 100
options3d.setViewDistance(100); // Default
conf.getChart().setOptions3d(options3d);
----

The 3D options are as follows:

[parameter]#alpha#:: The vertical tilt (pitch) in degrees.

[parameter]#beta#:: The horizontal tilt (yaw) in degrees.

[parameter]#depth#:: Depth of the third (Z) axis in pixel units.

[parameter]#enabled#:: Whether 3D plot is enabled. Default is [parameter]#false#.

[parameter]#frame#:: Defines the 3D frame, which consists of a back, bottom, and side panels that
display the chart grid.

[source, java]
+
----
Frame frame = new Frame();
Back back=new Back();
back.setColor(SolidColor.BEIGE);
back.setSize(1);
frame.setBack(back);
options3d.setFrame(frame);
----
[parameter]#viewDistance#:: View distance for creating perspective distortion. Default is 100.




[[charts.basic-use.3d.plotoptions]]
=== 3D Plot Options

The above sets up the general 3D view, but you also need to configure the 3D
properties of the actual chart type. The 3D plot options are chart type
specific. For example, a pie has __depth__ (or thickness), which you can
configure as follows:

[source, java]
----
// Set some plot options
PlotOptionsPie options = new PlotOptionsPie();
... Other plot options for the chart ...

options.setDepth(45); // Our pie is quite thick

conf.setPlotOptions(options);
----


[[charts.basic-use.3d.data]]
=== 3D Data

For some chart types, such as pies and columns, the 3D view is merely a visual
representation for one- or two-dimensional data. Some chart types, such as
scatter charts, also feature a third, __depth axis__, for data points. Such data
points can be given as [classname]#DataSeriesItem3d# objects.

The Z parameter is __depth__ and is not scaled; there is no configuration for
the depth or Z axis. Therefore, you need to handle scaling yourself as is done
in the following.

[source, java]
----
// Orthogonal data points in 2x2x2 cube
double[][] points = { {0.0, 0.0, 0.0}, // x, y, z
                      {1.0, 0.0, 0.0},
                      {0.0, 1.0, 0.0},
                      {0.0, 0.0, 1.0},
                      {-1.0, 0.0, 0.0},
                      {0.0, -1.0, 0.0},
                      {0.0, 0.0, -1.0}};

DataSeries series = new DataSeries();
for (int i=0; i<points.length; i++) {
    double x = points[i][0];
    double y = points[i][1];
    double z = points[i][2];

    // Scale the depth coordinate, as the depth axis is
    // not scaled automatically
    DataSeriesItem3d item = new DataSeriesItem3d(x, y,
        z * options3d.getDepth().doubleValue());
    series.add(item);
}
conf.addSeries(series);
----

Above, we defined 7 orthogonal data points in the 2x2x2 cube centerd in origo.
The 3D depth was set to 135 earlier. The result is illustrated in
<<figure.charts.basic-use.3d.scatter>>.

[[charts.basic-use.3d.distance]]
=== Distance Fade

To add a bit more 3D effect, you can do some tricks, such as calculate the
distance of the data points from a viewpoint and set the marker size and color
according to the distance.

[source, java]
----
public double distanceTo(double[] point, double alpha,
                         double beta, double viewDist) {
    final double theta = alpha * Math.PI / 180;
    final double phi   = beta * Math.PI / 180;
    double x = viewDist * Math.sin(theta) * Math.cos(phi);
    double y = viewDist * Math.sin(theta) * Math.sin(phi);
    double z = - viewDist * Math.cos(theta);
    return Math.sqrt(Math.pow(x - point[0], 2) +
                     Math.pow(y - point[1], 2) +
                     Math.pow(z - point[2], 2));
}
----

Using the distance requires some assumptions about the scaling and such, but for
the data points (as defined earlier) in range -1.0 to +1.0 we could do as
follows:

[source, java]
----
...
DataSeriesItem3d item = new DataSeriesItem3d(x, y,
    z * options3d.getDepth().doubleValue());

double distance = distanceTo(new double[]{x,y,z},
                             alpha, beta, 2);

Marker marker = new Marker(true);
marker.setRadius(1 + 10 / distance);
item.setMarker(marker);

series.add(item);
----

Note that here the view distance is in the scale of the data coordinates, while
the distance defined in the 3D options has different definition and scaling.
With the above settings, which are somewhat exaggerated to illustrate the
effect, the result is shown in <<figure.charts.basic-use.3d.fade>>.
